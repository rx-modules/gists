# Prelude
These are packs I'm *currently* playing with and not just packs I like. I'll try to add more packs that I like (since I missed a ton) in a [Honerable Mentions](#honerable-mentions) section.
All the packs listed here are generally compatible with each other, with most being [Smithed](https://smithed.dev) compatible.

> **Note**: I actively work on the Smithed ecosystem.

## Key Packs
These packs provide extensive additions to your world with very fleshed out mechanics and textures to go with them.

### [Mechanization](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/mechanization/)
I've never actually played with this pack before but it's been around for a *hot* minute. Adds a ton of content with machinery, ensuring balance through the complex flow of getting all your alloys *just* right.

- Fantastic in-game wiki, allows you to pin recipes to the item itself
- Adds new ores in-game (uses unused waterlogged blocks)
- Requires some heavy resources to start, especially getting used to the alloy systems
- Adds automation tools for several tasks (can be a bit much for some things)

### [Florcraft](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/florcraft-magical-essence-wizardry/)
Probably one of my favorite packs of all time, now with upgraded textures. Balances magic and tech (in a completely different way than Botany) to allow you to construct really cool systems that make your base feel alive.

- Adds really cute fairies (well wisps) to your world which are fun to gather
- Incentivizes good planning and designing in order to allow for further snowballing
- Extends world-building by hiding most knowledge through an unlock system
    - The lack of an in-game wiki for some of the specifics hurt (such as block ranges, etc)
    - This can be frustrating at first, but a bit of experimentation can help
- Super rewarding once mastered!

### [The Creeper's Code](https://github.com/CreeperMagnet/the-creepers-code)
The go-to pack for all things Vanilla+. I usually plop this into most world since it has a ton of small QOL changes I enjoy alongside with nice extensiosn to vanilla such as boomerangs, better/enabled bundles, and more.

- Contains a large list of QOL changes which are generally welcomed
- All more in-depth features (mini-bosses, jewelry) are well-designed and contained
- Works really well with other extensive packs as a supportive pack
- Enjoyable texturing work which meld with the vanilla textures


### [Gamemode 4](https://gm4.co)
These collection of packs are the data packs (and command blocks) I've used the longest. Requiring *no* resource pack, these packs are designed as a set of modules which define everything from small tweaks to large systems. These generally stem from vanilla+ to vanilla-adjacient but are generally unique enough to never clash with a modded-esque system. For this section, I'll list the modules I generally play with!

#### Machine Packs
- **Book Binders**: Cool extension to manipulating enchanted books
- **Block Compressors**: Very helpful for storage
- **Disassemblers**: Breaks apart already made things
- **Enchantment Extractors**: Chance to extract enchantments from gear
- **Liquid Tanks**: Store liquid in a tank (like XP, water, lava, etc).
  - **Potion Liquids**: Lets u store potions in tanks
- **Smelteries**: Multiply your ores
- **Relocators**: Relocate anything in this section

#### Zauber
- **Zauber Cauldrons**
  - Adds mid to late game potion extension system
  - Adds custom golden-augmented armor system
  - Adds crystals to augment other aspects (like constant effects)
- **Zauber Liquids**: Store those potions in tanks

#### Metallurgy
This is the largest designed system within gm4. Allows you to customize your weapons with custom augments called **Shamirs**. You can create these shamirs by blowing up rock with TNT. I generally add every shamir which exists here.

- **Metallurgy**
- **Audere Shamir**
- **Fulcio Shamir**
- **Iacio Shamir**
- **Lumos Shamir**
- **Percurro Shamir**
- **Vecto Shamir**
- **Vigere Shamir**
- **Tinkering Compressors**: Lets your compress automatically
- **Orb Of Ankou**: Extends the base pack even further
  - Adds a soul collecting aspect
  - I haven't fully explored this yet


#### Transporation
- **Vertical Rails**: Lets you use ladders as a vertical rail
- **Ziprails**: Make ziplines w/ zipwires for rails
- **Rope Ladders**: Lets you drop a ladder down

#### Odds & Ends
- **Apple Trees**: Special apple dropping trees
- **Cozy Campfires**: Sit next to campfire for Absorption
- **End Fishing**: Fish cool stuff from the End Void
- **Mysterious Midnights**: Some midnights can result in special blood moons
  - **Midnight Menaces**: Adds harder events to blood moons

## Key Worldgen
These packs are key for how I change the *base* of my world. Stardust Labs just takes the cake for everything here.

> **Note**: I'm on the Stardust team.

### [Terralith](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/terralith-overworld-evolved-100-biomes-caves-and-more/)
I honestly don't think I can go back to normal vanilla worlds after playing with this. I highly prefer the upgraded biomes and terrain that terralith offers. Starmute does an amazing job with design and direction here. It's nice that this works so nicely with florcraft essence generation as well.

### [Amplified Nether](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/amplified-nether-1-18/)
Amplified nether is a lighter take on the nether experience. It provides a ton of value for upgrading your nether while not overriding the entire experience.

### [Structory](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/structory/)
The newest Stardust Labs member! A ton of structures with great charm and care taken to integrate with your world. I can *instantly* tell which structures in-game come from this pack due to the great amount of detail and design work done. Very impressive build team going over there!

### [Nullscape](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/nullscape/)
The end revamp which captures the desolute soul of the void. Nullscape stands unique to most end revamps as it avoids the normal coloring and life additions from other mods. Instead, it adds very unique noise and terrain patterns providing something new to see at every twist and turn.


## Other Packs
These packs have a good chunk of content within them (and growing) but I'm may not be as familiar or they only provide a well-designed system for a certain mechanic.

### [Ocean Additions](https://smithed.dev/packs/primalugly/ocean_additions)
This is a newer pack which I haven't played with at all. Looks very well themed so I'm excited to dive deeper into it.

- Adds new mobs and bosses
    - They are out of the way so you have to seek them which I enjoy
- New items are based off of enemies you encouter, nice progression tree

### [Explorer's Advent](https://smithed.dev/packs/jachro/epa)
I don't know much about this pack yet, but I've gotten a couple maps. *Will add more later*.

### [Warp Pads](https://github.com/SmoochyPit/Warp-Pads-Rewrite)
While this pack adds some easier teleporting concepts to an early game, it's very well made making teleporting pretty fun and seemless w/o introducing a non-sensical UI. I recommend this for more casual servers where you just want to stay connected with friends.

### [VanillaTweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net/)
My go to place for smaller tweaks and additions to the game. I also regularly enjoy most of their resource packs. Take a look at my list:

> **Note**: I'm currently on the VanillaTweaks team.

- **Confetti Creepers**: Random confetti explosions. I usually set this to 50% chance.
- **Elevators**: Simple elevators with ender pearls and wool. I like this for base design.
- **Graves**: The most well-made grave pack. Makes dieing less frustrating as your items stay put.
    - If you want to keep some challenge, I recommend setting a grave despawn timer.
- **Fast Leave Decay**: I prefer only this to keeping a pack like Timber, etc
    - Other packs generally add a tree-feller ability through the progression tree
- **Double Shulker Shell Drops**: Just avoids people not finding end cities


## Other Structures
Adding more structures into the overworld adds a lot of character and exploration value for more people. While not every structure provides a key progression element, they help break up the world and add life making it more interesting to explore.

> Be weary of adding too many as they can either add too much noise, or cause some structures to never appear!

### [ChoiceTheorem's Overhauled Villagers](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/choicetheorem-s-overhauled-villages-for-1-19/)
I love adding new villagers to my world as it provides so much extra value for the underappreciated biomes in the world. It's the easiest early-game structure to entice newer players to explore your world. They also make for more engaging raids.

### [Towns & Towers](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/towns-amp-towers-structure-overhaul/)
Similarly to above, this pack goes further and adds other related overworld structures to spice things up. The creator of this pack, Kubek, has does an amazing job maintaining a large set of structures which has evolved at the same rate as worldgen in Minecraft.

### [Wabi Sabi](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/wabi-sabi-structures-datapack)
Very new pack which looked quite interesting; don't know much about this one.

### [Immersive Structures](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/immersive-structure-additional-structures-pack/)
Another ChoiceTheorem pack with odds and ends implemented; generally adding more character to my world.

# Honerable Mentions
I couldn't get to everything so here's an unorganized list of what I missed..

### [Incendium](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/incendium-nether-expansion/)

The first pack that truely showcased the extent of Minecraft's new worldgen, complete with custom items, mobs, and a boss to go with it. I've *personally* worked on this pack to extend and optimize of it's features so it will always have a place in my heart. While some of the items and design can be a bit of out scope for the overall progression of your world, it has a certain charm which I'll always appreciate. Definitely considering dropping this in later (with a nether reset).

### [Manic](https://smithed.dev/packs/hinge/manic)

This pack adds a very fleshed out insanity mechanic and contains some pretty awesome animated mobs and bosses to go with it. I haven't played with this yet, but I plan on adding it to my world.

### [Sanguine](https://smithed.dev/packs/hinge/sanguine)

This pack adds very fleshed out blood moons which visually tint your screen and adds a ton of scary mobs to handle. It also increases the difficulty the longer you've hung out in a world which may be a good or bad thing! Haven't played with it yet as well.
