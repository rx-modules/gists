William Wythers Overhauled Overworld
* *Completely overhauls almost every biome*
* *A really great refresh on vanilla, highly recommend*

More Structures Add On For William Wythers Overhauled

* *The biome files collide w/ above, but they are the same!*
* *I like structure packs*

Incendium
* *If you haven't heard, this is a nether overhaul pack*
* *Increases the difficulty of the nether tenfold*
* *Adds one of the most impressive structures w/ the Castle*
* *Also has an epic boss fight*

Battletowers Alpha
* *Adds classic battletowers that blow up on conquering*
* *The final boss loot adds random attributes to gear, which is cool*
* *Replaces 5 village centers though only appears in Plains due to other packs*

Fancier Mansions

Ships v11 for [1.16.5]

Tropical Volcano Biome
* *Adds a cool volano biome w/ a tropical feel*

Desert Village
* *This is a super sick village build*

Pillager Stronghold
* *These looked really cool in the screenshots*
* *I had to manually get the structure to spawn in the overhauled biomes*
* *Generates as a pillager outpost in biomes w/o them*
* *Haven't seen on yet, I think*

Illager Fortresses
* *This is an endgame structure which is onpar with Incendium's Castle*
* *The structures are varied and are very impressive*
* *This structure is very, very difficult by the nature of pillagers*
* *The loot could be better as far as I seen*

Pillager Settlements
* *Replaces the pillager outposts*
* *At the moment, these are colliding with the stronghold I think*
* *These are pretty nifty, definitely well built but it's a medium sized structure*

**Gamemode 4**

Not going to describe these. I just symlink them and delete the ones I don't want. Some like ziplines and vertical rails cause 10tps drop because they tick on minecarts (And there are a ton of those undeground).

Orbis and friends cause too much postgen lag unfortunately. In the days of worldgen, RIP.
