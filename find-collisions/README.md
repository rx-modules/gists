# Usage

Run `python3 main.py` in the same folder as your datapacks. Handles `zips` and folders. Only works on the `minecraft` namespace.

Also, it is an intended bug that files under multiple resources will collide. Ex: `minecraft/loot_tables/entity/zombie.json` will collide with `minecraft/loot_tables/blocks/zombie.json`.
